**UPDATE in 2020-05-16**
This project was started in order to spread the understanding of C++17 to the public and 
to prepare for C++20. 
I decided to **DISCONTINUE** it because it was understood.
This is the archive and there are no plans for future updates.

## What's this ?
The Japanese C++17 documents for beginners.

## Builds

* GitBook: https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/roki/thepolitewaylearntocpp17/
* Explanation of the codes covered in this document: https://falgon.github.io/ThePoliteWayLearnToCpp17/

To realize automation, various open source softwares and self-made softwares are used.
This figure shows the state transition until the book is deployed.
